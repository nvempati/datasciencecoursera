Getting Started with GitHub on Mac: (INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAC ONLY)===================================1. Signup for / Create GitHub Account (Free/paid)	- All repositories by default are public	- Free Membership: All the repositories are public you cannot have private	- Paid Membership: You can have repositories private (not searchable)2. Update profile as much as possible (you can do it at a later stage)3. Create Repository on GitHub (an online folder):	- On the Top right hand corner click +	- Select “New Repository”	- Enter Name of the repository (folder)	- Select the last option “Initialize this repository with a README” to create ReadMe (It is easier to do it now)	- AT THIS STAGE YOU HAVE A REPOSITORY ON GitHub.com	- Click the small button –it copies the link to your clipboard-- next to the “https link for the repository” (you’ll need this to clone the repository on your local machine)4. Open Terminal:	- Press command+space bar to launch “spotlight” search	- Type terminal usually the first option is terminal	- Press enter/return once the terminal is highlighted to launch Terminal5. You can get to the mac root folder by typing cd .. one sub dir at a time / type cd to the base (It should read as yourMacName$)6. I like to put most of my stuff under Documents folder so I bring my path up-to the “documents folder”	- Type (username$ ls) w/o parentheses to show the list of folder at the location in the command path	- Explore and get used to commands (cd & ls) by typing cd with the folder that you want to get into [ex: cd users gets you into users folder and then type (username$  ls) to see the list of folders, so on and so forth until you get to the desired directory level on your Mac	- If you know the location just type it with it’s full path cd path/path/path/destinationfolder [in my case ex: username$ cd users/username/documents --this is all of the Terminal commands you would need--	- Assuming that you have already installed GIT on your mac, if not click-here7. Your first git command starts here	- Type (username$ git clone “paste the https link that you copied from github.com”) --make sure you put space as shown, now the repository on github.com you created a little while ago is now copied on to your local machine	- To see the contents type (username$ ls) to see the folder	- Again type (username$ cd repositoryname) to get into the folder and you’ll see README.md file (Remember you checked an option while you created repository on github.com this is the file)	- Now manually move/save your files to the newly created folder on your Mac. You will work on your local machine and once finished you’ll move/push the updates from local machine to github.com for your team to collaborate or simply share your code with others8. Push/Move files in the local folder to the repository on GitHub.com	- Once you move files into the folder you need to upload/push from local to hithib.com	- Your second git command (username$ git status) this will give you status of the files in the local folder [Since you created and/or moved some file to the folder, your status message should tell you that it found/discovered new files and/or updates to existing “online” file. In short this is the difference in the contents between your local machine and github.com	- Your third git command (username$ git add filename) to move one file at a time	- To move all file at once (username$ git add -A) 	- Once you add the file(s) you are ready to committed	- Your fourth git command (username$ git commit –m ‘message’) is to commit your changes, make sure that you include a message with commit or the system will go a little nuts you’ll be thrown a big screen with some of the files that you wanted/tried to commit)	- If you were quick of the return trigger and pressed commit command w/o message all you have to do is:		* press key “i” that means insert		* type message (viz-a-viz commit message)		* press escape		* then type “:wq” and press enter/return, Tada that’s it
		* Now that you have committed, which means you created a sort of “image/state of the folder at this instance” and this is what will be pushed/copied onto github.com. Everything at this point is prepared & waiting in line to be pushed/uploaded.	- Your fifth git command (usename$ git push) once you have entered this command everything will be uploaded to github.com. You should get a mini message/report what was uploaded.	- Now go to github.com and refresh to check/see all the files uploaded into the online repository.9. Now if you want some one to get a copy of your repository to be reviewed they will have to make a pull request
