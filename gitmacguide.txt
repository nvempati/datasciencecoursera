Getting Started with GitHub on Mac: (INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAC ONLY)===================================

TL;DR (basic git commands after creating account on github.com)
================
0) from Terminal go to the directory (on your machine) you want to work from
1) git clone webURL (on github.com inside your repo a big green button clone/download)
2) git status (checks if there is difference in the repo online vs current machine)
3) git add -A (add all the updates/additions ‘if present’ to the staging area to be indexed for commit)
4) git commit -m ‘MUST INCLUDE A CUSTOM MESSAGE - WHAT ARE YOU UPDATING/CHANGING’ (Commits the updates/changes to be pushed to github.com)
5) git push (pushes all the file/updates to github)

There’s a lot of variation for git push once you get into branching you can learn more. Take one step at a time and refer some online videos on this subject (Plenty available on youtube for free). Once you get the hang of git it is one of the best version control system and almost an industry standard.
================
1. Signup for / Create GitHub Account (Free/paid)	- All repositories by default are public	- Free Membership: All the repositories are public you cannot have private	- Paid Membership: You can have repositories private (not searchable)2. Update profile as much as possible (you can do it at a later stage)3. Create Repository on GitHub (an online folder):	- On the Top right hand corner click +	- Select “New Repository”	- Enter Name of the repository (folder)	- Select the last option “Initialize this repository with a README” to create ReadMe (It is easier to do it now)	- AT THIS STAGE YOU HAVE A REPOSITORY ON GitHub.com	- Click the small button –it copies the link to your clipboard-- next to the “https link for the repository” (you’ll need this to clone the repository on your local machine)4. Open Terminal:	- Press command+space bar to launch “spotlight” search	- Type terminal usually the first option is terminal	- Press enter/return once the terminal is highlighted to launch Terminal5. You can get to the mac root folder by typing cd .. one sub dir at a time / type cd to the base (It should read as yourMacName$)6. I like to put most of my stuff under Documents folder so I bring my path up-to the “documents folder”	- Type (username$ ls) w/o parentheses to show the list of folder at the location in the command path	- Explore and get used to commands (cd & ls) by typing cd with the folder that you want to get into [ex: cd users gets you into users folder and then type (username$  ls) to see the list of folders, so on and so forth until you get to the desired directory level on your Mac	- If you know the location just type it with it’s full path cd path/path/path/destinationFolder [in my case ex: username$ cd users/username/documents --this is all of the Terminal commands you would need--	- Assuming that you have already installed GIT on your mac, if not click-here7. Your first git command starts here	- Type (username$ git clone “paste the https link that you copied from github.com”) --make sure you put space as shown, now the repository on github.com you created a little while ago is now copied on to your local machine	- To see the contents type (username$ ls) to see the folder	- Again type (username$ cd repositoryName) to get into the folder and you’ll see ReadMe.md file (Remember you checked an option while you created repository on github.com this is the file)	- Now manually move/save your files to the newly created folder on your Mac. You will work on your local machine and once finished you’ll move/push the updates from local machine to github.com for your team to collaborate or simply share your code with others8. Push/Move files in the local folder to the repository on GitHub.com	- Once you move files into the folder you need to upload/push from local to hithib.com	- Your second git command (username$ git status) this will give you status of the files in the local folder [Since you created and/or moved some file to the folder, your status message should tell you that it found/discovered new files and/or updates to existing “online” file. In short this is the difference in the contents between your local machine and github.com	- Your third git command (username$ git add filename) to move one file at a time	- To move all file at once (username$ git add -A) 	- Once you add the file(s) you are ready to committed	- Your fourth git command (username$ git commit –m ‘message’) is to commit your changes, make sure that you include a message with commit or the system will go a little nuts you’ll be thrown a big screen with some of the files that you wanted/tried to commit)	- If you were quick of the return trigger and pressed commit command w/o message all you have to do is:		* press key “i” that means insert		* type message (viz-a-viz commit message)		* press escape		* then type “:wq” and press enter/return, Tada that’s it
		* Now that you have committed, which means you created a sort of “image/state of the folder at this instance” and this is what will be pushed/copied onto github.com. Everything at this point is prepared & waiting in line to be pushed/uploaded.	- Your fifth git command (usename$ git push) once you have entered this command everything will be uploaded to github.com. You should get a mini message/report what was uploaded.	- Now go to github.com and refresh to check/see all the files uploaded into the online repository.9. Now if you want some one to get a copy of your repository to be reviewed they will have to make a pull request===============
Lessons Learned
===============
+ Close or push your work to github.com every single day. This is especially true in the initial learning phase to get familiar with git in general
+ Pull from Github every single day (Unless you deem it other wise, can be one of the best practice)
+ practice repo initiation with a readme file, good practice to write down what you have learned and tips for your personal use
+ Your ReadMe.md file should reflect as a pro document as much as possible short of publishing. Practice makes it second nature.
+ Delve into working from branches if possible. Say create a branch to work from another terminal (if you have one more computer or just play around with different ideas on the same code).
